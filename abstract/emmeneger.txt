
Categorical structures for comprehension and context extension

This talk is about the main categorical accounts of the set-theoretical operation of comprehension of a formula, and of the type-theoretical
operation of context extension. Intuitively, the two operations are connected: in both cases we are allowed to treat the formula/type as
true/inhabited. I will survey the categorical structures proposed by Lawvere, Ehrhard, Jacobs, and Dybjer to capture these operations, and
report on some recent results that clarify the relationships between these structures and provide some free constructions for them. 

This talk is based on joint work with Greta Coraglia, and with Francesco Dagnino and Andrea Giusto.
