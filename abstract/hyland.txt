A lesson from Tripos Theory

A surprising feature of the development of Tripos Theory was the use
of a technical notion called weak completeness in the definition of
certain functors between the generated Toposes. Recently in a paper
for the 70th birthday of Pino Rosolini I had again to rely on this.
In this talk I shall try to make the notion seem more natural using
an approach from the thesis of Andy Pitts. I hope in doing so to
raise questions on a broader front.
